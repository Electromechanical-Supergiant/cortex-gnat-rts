# cortex-gnat-rts branches #

Because of the interaction between the GNAT compiler and the runtime,
branches here reflect the compiler that the code in the branch is
compatible with. For this reason, the _master_ branch isn't the one to
use (even if it hasn't been deleted!)

## Finalization ##

Work on finalization is ongoing. It does add 8% to 9% to code size
even if not used.
